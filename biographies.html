            <h2>Daniel Hudson Burnham</h2>
            <p class="bio">Daniel Hudson Burnham was born on September 4, 1846, in Henderson, New York. He became a very good American architect and urban planner, known for his work in shaping the skylines of cities across the United States. In 1871, Burnham moved to Chicago, where he worked with architect John Wellborn Root to form the firm Burnham and Root. Together, they designed several influential buildings, including the Masonic Temple Building and the Monadnock Building. Burnham is best known for his role as the director of works for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he helped design the fair’s layout and significant "White City." His plan for the fair included grand, classical-style buildings that showed his commitment to monumental, traditional architecture. Burnham later became a leading figure in the development of the modern city, working on urban planning projects such as the 1909 Plan of Chicago, which focused on improving transportation, parks, and public spaces. Throughout his career, Burnham designed several other important buildings, including the Flatiron Building in New York City. He died on June 1, 1912, from cancer.</p>

            <h2>Sol Bloom</h2>
            <p class="bio">Sol Bloom was born March 9, 1870. His parents were both Jewish immigrants who raised Sol in San Francisco, California. Here, he was introduced to theater and soon became a theater manager. He later moved to Chicago, where he became famous for developing the mile long Midway Plaisance at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. His work at the fair made the term “midway” used with amusement areas at future world fairs. Afterward, Bloom moved to New York City, where he became involved in Tammany Hall politics and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1923. He served fourteen terms and became chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1939 to 1947. Sol supported the Lend-Lease Act and helped to establish the United Nations. Bloom also supported the creation of Israel and worked with President Truman to recognize it in 1948. He passed away one year later on March 7, 1949.

            <h2>Fredrick Law Olmsted</h2>
            <p class="bio">Frederick Law Olmsted was born on April 26, 1822, in Hartford, Connecticut. He is very well known as the father of American landscape architecture and for his work in designing some of the most iconic public parks in the United States. Olmsted worked as a farmer at first, but after traveling in Europe, he turned his interests to landscape design. He partnered with Calvert Vaux to create the design of Central Park in New York City, which became his most famous work. Olmsted’s designs emphasized natural beauty, social harmony, and the integration of green spaces within urban environments. In addition to Central Park, he worked on the design of Prospect Park in Brooklyn and the grounds of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Olmsted also planned park systems for cities like Boston and Buffalo and was influential in the development of national parks, including Yosemite and Niagara Falls. Olmsted continued working on landscape projects until his health declined, and he passed away on August 28, 1903.</p>
